<bizaro> true but in any case more CFM = faster heat dissipation
<&methodik> but if your area of heat dissipation is great enough

<~klassik> along with the ATF and CIA
<%septor> and demand COD
<&methodik> and you'll be MIA
<bizaro> or you will have to join the MIB
<~klassik> untill they deliver you DOA
<%septor> in a BAG
